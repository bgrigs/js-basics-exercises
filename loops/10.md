What is the difference between the following two code snippets? Check the MDN documentation on while and do...while.

  let counter = 0;

  while (counter > 0) {
    console.log('Woooot!');
    counter -= 1;
  }

  let counter = 0;

  do {
    console.log('Woooot!');
    counter -= 1;
  } while (counter > 0); 


The first snippet uses a while statement. Nothing will be logged to the console since the test condition is not met. The second snippet uses a do...while statement. In do...while statements, the condition is evaluated after executing the statement. THus, 'Woooot!' will be logged to the console.
